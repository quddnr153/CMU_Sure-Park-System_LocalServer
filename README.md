# CMU_Sure-Park-System_LocalServer

The goal of this project is to design a system that enables drivers to find and reserve parking spaces quickly and efficiently and is capable of monitoring and parking facilities operations. In this context “parking facilities” refers to traditional parking garages and parking lots. The project sponsors, Geoff’s Transportation and Parking Services (GTPS LLC), own several parking garages and lots. They have concerns about inefficiencies in their parking garages and lots. Key motivations for the project are to: (1) reduce driver frustration and enable them to easily find a parking facility with available parking slots and reserve them (2) more efficiently utilize the space in their parking facilities thereby increasing profits (3) reduce traffic congestion and the chance for accidents inside the parking facilities reducing liabilities (4) more efficiently utilize personnel and reduce the number of people required to operate any given garage reducing operating costs
